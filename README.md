# realTimeBusTracking

    This is a project developped during my course at MIT, 
using the mapbox js library a developed a real time tracker that adds on the map a blue marker every 15 secs
that highligths the position of a bus i took when i was on a campus in emmanuel college in Boston.
The golden marker highligths the position of emmanuel college on the map, the button on top runs the functions to make it work.
I plan on improving this project with some additional features and betterlooking elements.<br>

To use this program download the three files in a directory and open the html file. Or you can just go to andreagussoni.github.io/realTimeBusTracking
