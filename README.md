# realTimeBusTracking

This is a project developped during my course at MIT, 
using the mapbox js library a developed a real time tracker that adds on the map a blue marker every 15 secs
that highligths the position of a bus i took when i was on a campus in emmanuel college in Boston.
The golden marker highligths the position of emmanuel college on the map, the button on top runs the functions to make it work.

To use this program download the three files in a directory and open the html file.
